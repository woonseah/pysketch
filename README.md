# pysketch
Processing-like sketch programs but for Python projects (currently on Windows)

## Background
I have been using Processing 3 (Java) to write my programming projects for quite some time but started facing problems with importing external `.jar` libraries which my project requires into the Processing environment. I could switch to using Eclipse IDE and write the Java program from scratch but the whole point of using Processing was to avoid this (PTSD of Eclipse IDE slow compiles and missing imports). 

At this point, I switched to using `python` for my programming projects as I found it really easy to install packages using `pip`. However, after switching to python, I missed having the simplicity of only having setup() and draw() functions, and everything else running by itself like magic. GUI packages like Tkinter are powerful but a little too complex to setup, eating up precious development time for me. With this idea in mind, I wrote this `pysketch` project to help with development time when working with python.

## Dependencies
PySketch uses the following packages:
 * ```tkinter``` for the GUI Window
 * ```Pillow/PIL``` for the canvas, drawing tools, font and interface with Tk
 * ```pynput``` for capturing inputs from mouse and keyboard
 * ```numpy``` for processing the input image to draw on the screen
 * ```pywin32``` for checking if sketch window is being focused


Since this is a personal project, I wrote this without platform-cross-compatibility in mind or adding crazy amounts of error-handling. All I can say is that it works on my machine running Windows 10. ðŸ˜… If you need compatibility for other operating systems, some modifications of the code / own implementation is needed to replace `pywin32` which is actually only used to check if the sketch window is being focused or not.

## Usage
Place the `pysketch.py` module somewhere where you can access from python and import from. Simply create a new python `.py` script, follow the template below and run your sketch:

```
from pysketch import *

def setup():
    # setup code goes here
    pass

def draw():
    # draw code goes here
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    PySketch(globals())
```
## Available Methods
### Global Variables:
`width`, `height`, `displayWidth`, `displayHeight`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`, `key`, `focused`
### GUI and System Functions
 - `size(width: int, height: int)` : sets the dimensions of the sketch window.
 - `set_title(text: str)` : sets the title of the sketch window.
 - `set_resizable(resize: bool)` : sets whether resizing is enabled on the sketch window.
 - `set_window_location(x: int, y: int)` : sets the window location of the sketch window.
 - `millis()` : gets the time in milliseconds since the start of the sketch.
 - `delay(duration_ms: int)` : delay for the given duration in milliseconds.
### Drawing Style Functions
 - `fill(...)`^ : sets the fill color when drawing shapes on the canvas.
 - `stroke(...)`^ : sets the stroke color when drawing strokes on the canvas.
 - `noFill()` : disable fill with color where possible when drawing on the canvas.
 - `noStroke()` : disable drawing stroke where possible when drawing on the canvas.
### Canvas Drawing Functions
 - `background(...)`^ : clears the sketch canvas with the given input color.
 - `rect(x, y, w, h)` : draws a rectangle with given dimensions on the sketch canvas.
 - `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)` : draws a line between two points on the sketch canvas.
 - `image(img, x, y[, w, h])` : draws the input Image or numpy array at the given position and dimensions.
 - `textSize(size)` : sets the font text size used when drawing text.
 - `text(string, x, y)` : draws the input text at the given position in the sketch canvas.
